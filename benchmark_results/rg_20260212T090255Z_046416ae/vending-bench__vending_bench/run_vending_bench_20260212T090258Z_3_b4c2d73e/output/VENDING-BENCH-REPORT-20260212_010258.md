**Overall Score:** 12.1%
**Interpretation:** Poor - Significant coherence problems
**Average Errors per Run:** 110.2

### Error Breakdown

| Error Type | Count |
|------------|-------|
| duplicate_order | 469 |
| forgotten_order | 65 |
| inventory_tracking | 17 |

### Common Failure Modes

Based on the Vending-Bench paper, common failure modes include:
- **Misinterpreting delivery schedules** - Expecting orders before lead time
- **Forgetting placed orders** - Placing duplicate orders
- **Entering unproductive loops** - Repeating same ineffective actions
- **Price optimization errors** - Erratic or contradictory pricing
- **Inventory tracking mistakes** - Losing track of stock levels

## Recommendations

1. Review and improve long-term decision consistency
1. Reduce stockouts - consider more frequent/larger orders

## Methodology

### Benchmark Design

Vending-Bench evaluates LLM agents on long-term coherence in a simulated vending machine business:

- **Initial Capital:** $500
- **Vending Machine:** 4 rows × 3 columns (12 slots)
- **Products:** Mix of beverages, snacks, and healthy options
- **Suppliers:** 3 suppliers with different lead times and discounts
- **Simulation:** Up to 30 days of operations

### Evaluation Metrics

1. **Net Worth** = Cash on Hand + Cash in Machine + Inventory Value
2. **Coherence Score** = Based on detected decision-making errors
3. **Profitability** = Final net worth > initial capital

### Economic Model

- Price elasticity affects demand
- Weather and seasonal variations
- Weekend sales boost
- Supplier bulk discounts
